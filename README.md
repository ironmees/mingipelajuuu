## Clear Canvas Function

The provided code defines a function named `clear` that is used to clear the entire canvas. This function is particularly useful in applications involving drawing or animations, where you need to reset the canvas to a blank state before rendering new content.

Inside the `clear` function, the `clearRect` method of the `ctx` object is called. The `ctx` object typically refers to the 2D rendering context for a `<canvas>` element in HTML. The `clearRect` method takes four parameters: the x and y coordinates of the top-left corner of the rectangle to clear, and the width and height of the rectangle. In this case, the rectangle's dimensions are set to cover the entire canvas by using `canvas.width` and `canvas.height`, effectively clearing the whole canvas area.

This function is a common utility in canvas-based applications to ensure that any previous drawings are removed before new drawings are made, preventing overlapping or unwanted artifacts from previous frames.
